# Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

## Background

This project analyzes the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. The objective was to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships: Temperature (F) vs. Latitude, Humidity (%) vs. Latitude, Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude, and Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude.

This site provides the source data and visualizations created using Pandas and Matplotlib with observable trends.
